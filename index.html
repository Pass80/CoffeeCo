                            <p>
                                I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in
                                Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give
                                up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no catering
                                experience, the only way I knew how to operate a
                                business was NOT to look at it as a business. I
                                treated it like my home and all the customers
                                were guests in my home.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After 13 years, I still stand by the same
                                principle as I have not yet learnt the art of
                                the business but have mastered the art of being
                                a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and
                                cook the food I serve to my family at home.
                                Everything is freshly cooked on site and served
                                immediately to our guests.
